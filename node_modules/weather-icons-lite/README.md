## Basic Usage

The icons are displayed by using an `i` element and adding the base class `wi` and then the icon class you want, so for example, using Wunderground's 'wu' prefix and their 'partlycloudy' icon key. This would then look like `<i class="wi wi-wu-partlycloudy"></i>`.

To add a modifier, include the class you want after the icon name, which looks like `<i class="wi wi-wu-partlycloudy wi-flip-vertical"></i>`. You can flip, rotate, or add a fixed width. For further examples of how to apply different effects, see [Font Awsome](http://fontawesome.io/examples/).

## API Usage

This set includes companion CSS files for popular weather service API. Presently there are complete CSS mappings for Darksky, Open Weather Map and Weather Underground.
